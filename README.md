# Frontend Developer Take-Home Assessment

**Crypto Checkout Experience (React / Next.js)**

## 📌 Overview

This project is a frontend implementation of a **crypto checkout experience**, similar in concept to Stripe Checkout but for crypto payments.

The goal of this assessment is to demonstrate the ability to:

- Translate Figma designs into clean, responsive UI
- Build well-structured, reusable React/Next.js components
- Handle basic form state and interactions
- Write production-ready, maintainable frontend code

No backend integration is included — all data is mocked where necessary.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build **2 screens/pages** from the provided Figma design that best showcase:

- UI accuracy
- Component structure
- State handling
- Code quality

---

## 🎨 Design Reference

**Figma Design:**
🔗 [https://www.figma.com/design/FRfbMHys4JINX4V9qBxgbf/Frontend-Assessment?node-id=0-1](https://www.figma.com/design/FRfbMHys4JINX4V9qBxgbf/Frontend-Assessment?node-id=0-1)

---

## 🧩 Selected Screens

The following screens were implemented from the design:

- **[Page 1]** – This page is where the user inputs the details of the sending and receiving currencies and wallets
- **[Page 5]** – This is the success page that includes a button that takes the user back to Page 1

> These screens were chosen to demonstrate form handling, layout structure, and interactive UI elements.

## 🌍 Live Demo

- **Live URL:** https://novacrust-task-8xir.vercel.app/

---

## 🧠 Assumptions & Trade-offs

- No backend or real crypto payment integration was implemented.
- Static or mock data is used for prices and payment details.
- Focus was placed on **UI accuracy and component quality** rather than advanced architecture.
- Accessibility was handled at a basic but reasonable level given the scope.

---

## ⏱ Time Spent

Approximately **4–6 hours**, as recommended in the assessment brief.

---

## 📝 Notes

- The solution avoids overengineering and focuses on clarity and maintainability.
- Code is written with readability and scalability in mind.
- Design fidelity was prioritized to closely match the Figma reference.
